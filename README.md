# TMP36_sensor - Temperature Sensor
### A basic code and diagram of TMP36 temperature sensor interfaced with arduino on a simulation platform Tinkercad
### Components:
1. Arduino UNO
2. Breadboard
3. LCD 16x2
4. Resistor 220 ohm (To keep current through LCD under limit)
5. Potentiometer (To adjust contrast of message displayed on LCD)
6. TMP36 (Since it is a simulation , real time temperature values are not recorded but, tmp36 gives the ability to change temperature as per requirement by providing a drag scale)
7. Power Supply
